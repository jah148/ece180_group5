Higher education policy:
  feature: Education Expenditures / GNI

Socioeconomic Factors:
  feature:
    1. Technology -- Quantitative indicators：Amount of papers & panel released
    2. Social Mobility -- Quantitative indicators：Intergenerational mobility
    3. Social Equality -- Quantitative indicators：Gini coefficient

I think we can use these three socioeconomic factors as criteria to judge whether a country does good in higher education policy.

As this is a draft of my idea, I will later add on doc strings and asserts to  the code.
