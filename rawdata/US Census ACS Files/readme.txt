Read the Excel Inport Tool pdf for instructions on how to look at raw data labeled inside Excel.

You will need 3 files:
Summary file data
Excel Template that matches the data txt file
Excel geography file "1_year_Mini_Geo.xlsx"

To match summary files to template file, match their numbers.
Example: Data file "e20161ak0029000.txt" matches "Seq29.xls"


TODO: Fill this folder with only the relevant raw data that we will use for the data visualization project. That is, items like population data, salary earnings, number of majors obtained, etc.
